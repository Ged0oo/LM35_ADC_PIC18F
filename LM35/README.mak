Interfacing LM35 sensor with PIC18F MCU using ADC Module in chanel AN0.
With the connection of 4x20 Character LCD on PORTB of the MCU we get the value of the 
LM35 sensor fron the ADC Module and then Puting it in the sreen.
We just make a simple check on the LM35 value and then make a condition to control
the motion of the two DC motors which are connected to the MCU.
